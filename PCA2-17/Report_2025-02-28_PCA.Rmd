### 1. Study of the outliers
The analysis of the graphs does not detect any outlier.

### 2. Inertia distribution
The inertia of the first dimensions shows if there are strong relationships between variables and suggests the number of dimensions that should be studied.

The first two dimensions of analyse express **65.59%** of the total dataset inertia ; that means that 65.59% of the individuals (or variables) cloud total variability is explained by the plane.
This percentage is relatively high and thus the first plane well represents the data variability.
This value is strongly greater than the reference value that equals **40.83%**, the variability explained by this plane is thus highly significant
(the reference value is the 0.95-quantile of the inertia percentages distribution obtained by simulating 11625 data tables of equivalent size on the basis of a normal distribution).

From these observations, it should be better to also interpret the dimensions greater or equal to the third one.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.height = 3.5, fig.width = 5.5}
par(mar = c(2.6, 4.1, 1.1, 2.1))
ggplot2::ggplot(cbind.data.frame(x=1:nrow(res.PCA$eig),y=res.PCA$eig[,2])) + ggplot2::aes(x=x, y=y)+ ggplot2::geom_col(fill="blue") + ggplot2::xlab("Dimension") + ggplot2::ylab("Percentage of variance") + ggplot2::ggtitle("Decomposition of the total inertia") + ggplot2::theme_light() + ggplot2::theme(plot.title = ggplot2::element_text(hjust =0.5)) + ggplot2::scale_x_continuous(breaks=1:nrow(res.PCA$eig))
```

**Figure 2 - Decomposition of the total inertia**

An estimation of the right number of axis to interpret suggests to restrict the analysis to the description of the first 2 axis.
These axis present an amount of inertia greater than those obtained by the 0.95-quantile of random distributions (65.59% against 40.83%).
This observation suggests that only these axis are carrying a real information.
As a consequence, the description will stand to these axis.

### 3. Description of the plane 1:2

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.height = 3.5, fig.width = 5.5}
drawn <-
c("209", "95", "223")
par(mar = c(4.1, 4.1, 1.1, 2.1))
plot.PCA(res.PCA, select = drawn, axes = c(1,2), choix = 'ind', invisible = 'quali', title = '', cex = cex)
```

**Figure 3.1 - Individuals factor map (PCA)**
*The labeled individuals are those with the higher contribution to the plane construction.*

The Wilks test p-value indicates which variable factors are the best separated on the plane (i.e. which one explain the best the distance between individuals).
```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.height = 3.5, fig.width = 5.5}
wilks.p <-
c(Metadata_Stiffness = 4.8534290876173913e-52, Abb_ECM = 0.31093126046432795
)
wilks.p
```
The best qualitative variable to illustrate the distance between individuals on this plane is : *Metadata_Stiffness*.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.height = 3.5, fig.width = 5.5}
sample = sample(rownames(res.PCA$call$X), length(rownames(res.PCA$call$X)))
res.PCA$call$X = res.PCA$call$X[sample,]
res.PCA$ind$coord = res.PCA$ind$coord[sample[!sample %in% rownames(res.PCA$ind.sup$coord)],]
res.PCA$ind.sup$coord = res.PCA$ind.sup$coord[sample[sample %in% rownames(res.PCA$ind.sup$coord)],,drop=FALSE]
drawn <-
c("209", "95", "223")
hab <-
"Metadata_Stiffness"
par(mar = c(4.1, 4.1, 1.1, 2.1))
plotellipses(res.PCA, axes = 1:2, select = drawn, keepvar = hab, title = '', cex = cex)
```

**Figure 3.2 - Individuals factor map (PCA)**
*The labeled individuals are those with the higher contribution to the plane construction.*
*The individuals are coloured after their category for the variable* Metadata_Stiffness.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.height = 3.5, fig.width = 5.5}
drawn <-
c("Mean_PXR", "Proliferation_DMSO", "Mean_Ecad", "Survival_20 uM", 
"Mean_Vimentin", "Adhesion")
par(mar = c(4.1, 4.1, 1.1, 2.1))
plot.PCA(res.PCA, select = drawn, axes = 1:2, choix = 'var', title = '', cex = cex)
plot.PCA(res.PCA, select = drawn, axes = 1:3, choix = 'var', title = '', cex = cex)
plot.PCA(res.PCA, select = drawn, axes = 2:3, choix = 'var', title = '', cex = cex)
```

**Figure 3.3 - Variables factor map (PCA)**
*The variables in black are considered as active whereas those in blue are illustrative.*
*The labeled variables are those the best shown on the plane.*

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.height = 3.5, fig.width = 5.5}
drawn <-
c("25kPa", "1kPa", "C4HA", "LNDN", "DNG3", "LNOPN", "C1OPN",

The **dimension 1** opposes individuals such as *223* and *95* (to the right of the graph, characterized by a strongly positive coordinate on the axis)
